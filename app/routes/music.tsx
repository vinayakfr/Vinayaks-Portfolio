              It all started in <a>3rd grade</a> when Vinayak got an ultimatem
              between Dance. Music and Theatre. With a promise to his mother
              that Vinayak will sing all the songs taught to him in Music, his
              mother filled out the music check-box. He wasn't very keen at
              first but his interest{" "}

              when he met his new music teacher in 5th Grade. It didn't take
              much time for the new teacher to become his idol. Vinayak became
              more{" "}

              his music room. Taking Vinayak's old music teacher's suggestion to
              make him learn{" "}

              seriously, his mother put him in Tabla classes for one year.
              Vinayak wasn't very fond of Tabla, even though he was rather very
              good in it. <br />
              In 6th grade, Vinayak became one of the{" "}

                orchestra group{" "}
              </a>
              , and it was pretty big deal for him. He loved the stay backs and
              the early morning practices and how he could skip class periods
              for his 'orchestra practice'. He also loved how his music teacher
              would pick him up in the morning and drop him back at home after
              practice. The Orchestra team was always in the top three but never
              scored the first position.
              <br />
              In 8th Grade, Vinayak started developing interest in{" "}

              , so he joined his music teacher's music school. Vinayak was a
              'quick leaner' as his teacher would say, he sure was{" "}
              <a className="bg-gradient-to-tr from-zinc-400 via-rose-600 to-zinc-400 text-transparent bg-clip-text animate-pulse">
                talented

              became a part of his new school's orchestra team, not to his
              surprise, he was still on the{" "}

              as he was before. With his new team, Vinayak went back to his old
              school, where his journey began, to complete the circle. This
              time, he won the{" "}

              Vinayak was happy and nostalgic, both at the same time as he
              celebrated his victory with his team-mates.
