              I had no other option but to choose music because it was the most
              comfortable option compared to dance and theatre. But this choice
              also had its conditions: my mother made me promise that I would
              sing and play for her all the songs that were taught to me in
              music class. And as you can all guess, my interest was nowhere
              near music when I first started my journey; at that time, I didn't
              even know my time with music would eventually become a{" "}

              sparked when I met my new music teacher in 5th grade. It didn't
              take long for him to become one of the people I respect the most.
              In his presence, I became more and more{" "}

              with the subject and wanted to learn every instrument in the music
              room. Looking back, I believe it was never about the subject but
              the people I met through music and the memories I made.
              <br />
              The first instrument I sincerely learned was the{" "} <a className="bg-gradient-to-tr from-zinc-400 via-rose-600 to-zinc-400 text-transparent bg-clip-text animate-pulse">tabla</a>. My mother
              enrolled me in tabla classes for one year, but gradually, I lost
              interest. In{" "} <a className="bg-gradient-to-tr from-zinc-400 via-rose-600 to-zinc-400 text-transparent bg-clip-text animate-pulse">6th grade</a>, I became one of the{" "} <a className="bg-gradient-to-tr from-zinc-400 via-rose-600 to-zinc-400 text-transparent bg-clip-text animate-pulse">founding members</a> of my
              school's orchestra group, which was a pretty big deal for me. I
              used to love the stay-backs and the practices in between classes.
              It gave me a chance to skip some boring subjects, which were
              boring only because I got to do something that I loved. We
              participated in{" "} <a className="bg-gradient-to-tr from-zinc-400 via-rose-600 to-zinc-400 text-transparent bg-clip-text animate-pulse">Zonal Level Orhestra Competitions{" "}</a>but never won;
              we were either placed in 2nd or 3rd position. In 8th grade, I
              started developing an interest in stringed instruments, so I
              joined my music teacher's school. I was a{" "} <a className="bg-gradient-to-tr from-zinc-400 via-rose-600 to-zinc-400 text-transparent bg-clip-text animate-pulse"> "quick learner,"</a> as my
              teacher would say. I took my first music exam and passed with
              merit from Trinity College of Music, London. After changing
              schools in 11th grade, I joined my new school's orchestra team.
              This time, we won the{" "} <a className="bg-gradient-to-tr from-zinc-400 via-rose-600 to-zinc-400 text-transparent bg-clip-text animate-pulse">Zonal Level Orchestra Competition.</a>
