It all started in 3rd grade when Vinayak was given an ultimatum between Dance, Music, and Theatre. With a promise to his mother that he would sing all the songs taught to him in Music, she filled out the music check-box. He wasn't very keen at first, but his interest <a className="bg-gradient-to-tr from-zinc-400 via-rose-600 to-zinc-400 text-transparent bg-clip-text animate-pulse">
                sparked{" "}
              </a> when he met his new music teacher in 5th grade. It didn't take much time for the new teacher to become his idol. Vinayak became more  <a className="bg-gradient-to-tr from-zinc-400 via-rose-600 to-zinc-400 text-transparent bg-clip-text animate-pulse">
                fascinated{" "}
              </a> by music and wanted to learn everything he could in his music room. Following his old music teacher's suggestion to make him learn the <a className="bg-gradient-to-tr from-zinc-400 via-rose-600 to-zinc-400 text-transparent bg-clip-text animate-pulse">
                Tabla{" "}
              </a> seriously, his mother enrolled him in tabla classes for one year. Although Vinayak wasn't very fond of the tabla, he was quite good at it.

In 6th grade, Vinayak became one of the  <a className="bg-gradient-to-tr from-zinc-400 via-rose-600 to-zinc-400 text-transparent bg-clip-text animate-pulse">
                founding members{" "}
              </a> of his school <a className="bg-gradient-to-tr from-zinc-400 via-rose-600 to-zinc-400 text-transparent bg-clip-text animate-pulse">
                orchestra group{" "}
              </a>, which was a pretty big deal for him. He loved the stay-backs and the early morning practices, as well as the fact that he could skip class periods for his 'orchestra practice.' He also loved how his music teacher would pick him up in the morning and drop him back at home after practice. The orchestra team always placed in the top three but never scored first place.

In 8th grade, Vinayak started developing an interest in <a className="bg-gradient-to-tr from-zinc-400 via-rose-600 to-zinc-400 text-transparent bg-clip-text animate-pulse">
                string instruments
              </a>, so he joined his music teacher's music school. Vinayak was a 'quick learner,' as his teacher would say; he was indeed <a className="bg-gradient-to-tr from-zinc-400 via-rose-600 to-zinc-400 text-transparent bg-clip-text animate-pulse">
                talented
              </a>. Vinayak took his first music exam in guitar from <a className="bg-gradient-to-tr from-zinc-400 via-rose-600 to-zinc-400 text-transparent bg-clip-text animate-pulse">
                Trinity College
              </a>, London. After changing schools in 11th grade, Vinayak became a part of his new school's orchestra team. Not to his surprise, he was still on <a className="bg-gradient-to-tr from-zinc-400 via-rose-600 to-zinc-400 text-transparent bg-clip-text animate-pulse"> percussion </a>, as he was before. With his new team, Vinayak returned to his old school, where his journey began, to complete the circle. This time, he won the <a className="bg-gradient-to-tr from-zinc-400 via-rose-600 to-zinc-400 text-transparent bg-clip-text animate-pulse">
                Zonal Level Orchestra Competition.{" "}
              </a>. Vinayak felt both happy and nostalgic as he celebrated his victory with his teammates.
